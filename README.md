# Chess-Game


A text-based chess game implemented in Java, where two players take turns moving pieces on an 8x8 chessboard. The game supports standard chess rules, including piece movement, captures, checkmate, and offers a restart option when the game ends.

## Features

- **Chess Pieces**: Implements all chess pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).
- **Turn-based Play**: Players alternate turns, with White going first and Black second.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when a king is captured.
- **Restart Option**: After the game ends, players can restart the game.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile and run the `ChessGame` class.
3. The chessboard will be displayed with pieces in their initial positions.
4. Enter moves using algebraic notation (e.g., e2 e4).
5. Once a king is captured, the game will announce the winner and prompt for a restart.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later.
